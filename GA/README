shift_wig.pl should be used instead of lower_wig2fa.pl.

These scripts are the FINAL scripts used for peak calling and producing the models that are used with stochhmm. 

All scripts that are needed for running GA should be here

NOTE: This code is VERY VERY alpha
  there is a lot of hardcoding
  G_A code is very messy, still has debug statements and comments
  make_cache is VERY specific to a certain region
  evaluate() calls the evaluate script by a diffent model
  still assuming lower_wig2fa
  and many other problems.

Code is technically correct and WILL run if in the correct directories, with other scripts in corrct directories, but is too specific and hardcoded.

Major cleaning up needed.

DO NOT RUN GA without CAREFUL inspection of source code and complete understanding of WHICH scripts go WHERE.
