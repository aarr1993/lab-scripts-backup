Globals:

mutation_rate       : percent of pop/em that is mutated
max_mutation_change : max percent a value can be mutated by
crossover_rate      : frequency of crossover
parent_size         : percent of population to use for mating
order               : order of the HMM
emissions           : number of emissions
template_hmm        : Input template HMM without any emissions
sequence_file       : fasta file of region to call peaks on
initial_model       : input initial HMM model
population_size     : size of pop
generations         : number of generations to run
threshold           : threshold to pass to stochhmm
threads             : number of threads
output_dir          : directory to output to
